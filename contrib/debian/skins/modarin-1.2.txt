Description: add 8 beautiful 256 color skins "modarin-1.2"
 With most of the common desktop terminals, enabling 256-color mode is easily
 done just by setting $TERM to "xterm-256color". Ubuntu users: make sure that
 the ncurses-term package is installed.
 .
 Hint: if you decide to use a 256-color skin as default skin in your mc ini,
 note that if mc is started in a 16-color terminal, mc will pop up a warning
 saying that 256 color skins can't be used and that mc will switch to the
 "default" skin. To get a skin of your choice loaded instead of mc's default
 skin, you might consider the following solution:
 .
 Create an alias for mc in your ~/.bashrc, like:
    if [ $TERM = "linux" ]; then
        if [ $USER = "root" ]; then
            myMCFallbackSkin="modarcon16root-defbg"
        else
            myMCFallbackSkin="modarcon16-defbg"
        fi
        alias mc="mc --skin $myMCFallbackSkin"
        alias mcedit="mcedit --skin $myMCFallbackSkin"
        alias mcview="mcview --skin $myMCFallbackSkin"
        alias mcdiff="mcdiff --skin $myMCFallbackSkin"
    fi
 Linux users: to use 256-color skins in the linux console, run fbterm,
 set $TERM to "fbterm" and then run mc within fbterm.
 You need to specify a gfx mode in your bootloader for the kernel to use a
 framebuffer console instead of the default text mode.
